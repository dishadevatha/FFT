With the fast-changing world, it is important that we adapt to the changes to best of our ability in all ways. Advancement of technology has allowed for the facilitation of remote ordering of food, as well as remote payment for the same. Therefore, it is vital that students or professors are able to do the same on campus. The goal is to develop an app to improve the food ordering experience for users on campus by allowing users to pre-order and pre-pay for food with on-campus food vendors. The app allows users to browse menus, customize orders and make payments through the same platform, enhancing efficiency and minimizing wait times. This system helps simplify the ordering process and ensures reliable payment by allowing remote payment enabling ordering food in areas with low network connectivity.
